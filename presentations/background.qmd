# Introduction

Exposure-response (E-R) analysis is a regulatory cornerstone for dose selection. This document outlines the rationale and structure for adopting CDISC standards in E-R workflows.

# Literature Review

Exposure-response (E-R) analysis has become an essential regulatory requirement for optimizing dose selection. However, the efficacy of these analyses is often limited by inconsistent data structures.

Recent literature from 2025 and 2026 emphasizes that adopting the **Analysis Data Model (ADaM)**—specifically the **ADPPK** dataset structure—is critical for modern model-informed drug development. Key benefits cited in the literature include:

-   **Traceability:** Establishing an audit trail from raw eCRF data to final results.
-   **Efficiency:** Reducing manual data cleaning using **Basic Data Structure (BDS)** formats.
-   **Integration:** Enabling cross-study meta-analyses, which is vital for rare diseases.

# Proposed Data Structure (ADaM ADPPK)

To support E-R modeling, the following variables should be mapped within the ADaM framework:

| E-R Parameter         | PARAMCD | PARAM                           | AVAL    | Source |
|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|
| Area Under the Curve  | AUCSS   | AUC at steady state (ug\*h/mL)  | Numeric | ADPC   |
| Maximum Concentration | CMAX    | Maximum concentration (ug/mL)   | Numeric | ADPC   |
| Efficacy Response     | PASI    | Psoriasis Area & Severity Index | Numeric | ADRS   |
| Safety Response       | ALT     | Alanine Aminotransferase (U/L)  | Numeric | ADLB   |
| Time to Event         | TTDIS   | Time to discontinuation (Days)  | Numeric | ADTTE  |

# Conclusion

The transition to CDISC standards for E-R modeling ensures that datasets are analysis-ready and compliant with global regulatory mandates (FDA/PMDA).
