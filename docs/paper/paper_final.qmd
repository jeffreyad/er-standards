# Abstract

Exposure-Response (ER) modeling is a key tool in assessing the safety and efficacy of new drugs, enabling evaluation of the relationship between drug exposure, toxicity, and clinical benefit. ER datasets often resemble those used in Population Pharmacokinetic (PopPK) modeling, sharing features such as numeric covariates, relative time variables, and dependent outcomes. While CDISC released standards for PopPK data in 2023, no equivalent standards currently exist for ER data. However, many of the same principles could be applied. This paper explores ER datasets across three domains: Exposure-Efficacy (EE), with endpoints like Overall Survival (OS) and Progression-Free Survival (PFS); Exposure-Safety (ES), which may include specific adverse event frequencies; and Tumor Response, which may include measures of tumor size over time. Using the {admiral} R package, we demonstrate programming examples that illustrate how ER data can be structured in alignment with emerging standards, supporting consistency and reproducibility in modeling workflows. We propose a framework for standardizing ER data that extends CDISC SDTM-PK principles while accommodating the unique requirements of each domain.

# Introduction

## Background on Exposure-Response Modeling

Exposure-response (ER) modeling plays a critical role in modern drug development, providing quantitative frameworks to characterize relationships between drug exposure measures (such as steady-state area under the concentration-time curve \[AUCSS\] or maximum concentration \[CMAXSS\]) and clinical outcomes. These relationships inform key regulatory and clinical decisions, including dose selection, dosing regimen optimization, and identification of patient populations most likely to benefit from treatment [@fda_erpk_guidance].

The scope of ER modeling spans multiple domains. In the efficacy realm, analysts examine how exposure relates to desirable clinical outcomes such as overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), or objective response rates. Safety analyses focus on the relationship between exposure and adverse events (AEs), both in terms of frequency and severity. Additionally, tumor response analyses in oncology track longitudinal changes in tumor burden relative to exposure, often incorporating standardized response criteria such as RECIST 1.1 [@eisenhauer_recist].

Despite the central importance of ER modeling in drug development, the datasets supporting these analyses lack standardization. Traditional approaches typically include only 3-5 exposure variables (e.g., AUC, CMAX, CAVG) with inconsistent naming conventions and limited transformation options. Unlike pharmacokinetic (PK) data, which benefits from the CDISC Standard Data Tabulation Model for Pharmacokinetics (SDTM-PK) released in 2023 [@cdisc_sdtmpk], ER data structures remain heterogeneous across studies and organizations. This variability creates several challenges:

1.  **Reproducibility**: Inconsistent data structures make it difficult to replicate analyses or compare results across studies
2.  **Efficiency**: Each analysis requires custom data preparation, preventing code reuse
3.  **Limited exposure representations**: Traditional datasets lack comprehensive exposure transformations
4.  **Quality**: Lack of standardization increases the risk of errors in data derivation
5.  **Regulatory clarity**: Inconsistent documentation complicates regulatory review
6.  **Collaboration**: Sharing methodologies across organizations is hampered by structural differences

## CDISC SDTM-PK as a Foundation

The CDISC SDTM-PK standard, finalized in 2023, provides a robust framework for representing pharmacokinetic data in a standardized format. Key principles include:

-   **Relative time variables**: PCTPT (planned time point) and PCELTM (elapsed time) enable consistent representation of temporal relationships
-   **Numeric analysis values**: PCSTRESN provides analysis-ready numeric results
-   **Traceability**: Clear linkage between collection and analysis through date/time variables
-   **Metadata**: Standardized parameter codes (PCTESTCD) facilitate data exchange
-   **8-character variable names**: All variables comply with CDISC ADaM requirements

While SDTM-PK focuses on concentration measurements themselves, many of its underlying principles are directly applicable to ER analyses. Both domains require:

-   Careful handling of time relative to dosing
-   Integration of exposure metrics with outcome data
-   Support for both continuous and categorical analyses
-   Clear documentation of derivation rules
-   Compliance with CDISC naming conventions

However, ER modeling introduces additional complexity not addressed by SDTM-PK:

-   **Outcome diversity**: Time-to-event, count, continuous, and categorical endpoints
-   **Longitudinal structures**: Repeated outcome measurements over time
-   **Complex relationships**: Non-linear exposure-response curves, threshold effects
-   **Time-varying exposures**: Dose modifications, cumulative exposure
-   **Comprehensive exposure transformations**: Need for multiple representations (log, standardized, categorical)

## The {admiral} Package Ecosystem

The {admiral} R package, part of the pharmaverse initiative, provides a comprehensive framework for creating Analysis Data Model (ADaM) datasets [@admiral2024]. Key features relevant to ER standardization include:

-   **Modular functions**: Reusable derivation functions following consistent patterns
-   **Built-in validation**: Assertion functions that catch errors early
-   **Metadata integration**: Works with {metacore}, {metatools}, and {xportr} for specification management
-   **CDISC compliance**: Designed around ADaM principles
-   **Community support**: Active development and extensive documentation

The {admiral} framework has proven successful for standard ADaM datasets (ADSL, ADAE, ADLB, ADTTE). Its modular approach makes it well-suited for extension to ER-specific needs while maintaining consistency with established patterns.

The latest version of {admiral} (v1.4) includes experimental functions to facilitate PK analysis including `derive_var_nfrlt()` for deriving nominal time NFRLT "Nominal Relative Time from First Dose" which uses `convert_xxtpt_to_hours()` to convert PCTPT or other SDTM timepoints to numeric hours using regular expressions.

Open-source projects like {admiral} include numerous examples of reusable functions, templates and code blocks that can be used in new programming. The Pharmaverse as a whole strives to provide a collection of open-source tools applicable to clinical reporting and electronic submissions.

## Objectives

This paper aims to:

1.  Propose a standardized framework for ER data across four specialized datasets (ADER, ADEE, ADES, ADTRR)
2.  Demonstrate example exposure metric coverage
3.  Ensure full CDISC compliance including 8-character variable name limits
4.  Demonstrate implementation using {admiral} and related packages
5.  Identify common patterns that enable code reuse across domains
6.  Provide practical examples that can be adapted for real-world applications
7.  Initiate community discussion toward potential formalization of ER standards

# Methods

## Proposed Framework

This framework extends CDISC ADaM principles to accommodate ER modeling requirements. We propose four specialized dataset types aligned with major ER domains:

### ADER: Analysis Dataset for Exposure-Response (Foundation)

**Primary use case**: Foundational dataset containing comprehensive exposure metrics and baseline covariates

**Key features**:

-   One record per subject
-   Exposure metrics covering all common transformations
-   Baseline covariates for modeling
-   All variable names ≤ 8 characters (CDISC compliant)
-   Foundation for ADEE, ADES, and ADTRR datasets

**Example Exposure Metrics**:

| Category | Variables | Description |
|----------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Raw** | AUCSS, CMAXSS, CAVGSS | Steady-state exposure metrics |

|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| **Vitals**           | WTBL, HTBL, BMIBL, BSA  | Body measurements |
| **Renal function**   | CREATBL, CRCLBL, EGFRBL | Kidney function   |
| **Hepatic function** | ALTBL, ASTBL, TBILBL    | Liver function    |

### ADEE: Analysis Dataset for Exposure-Efficacy

**Primary use case**: Time-to-event analyses relating exposure to efficacy endpoints

**Key features**:

-   One record per subject per parameter (e.g., OS, PFS, TTP, TTNT)
-   AVAL represents time from treatment initiation to event (in days)
-   CNSR indicates censoring status (1 = censored, 0 = event)
-   EVENT provides event indicator (1 = event, 0 = censored) for modeling convenience
-   All exposure metrics from ADER available
-   Example baseline covariates from ADER
-   Analysis flags for population selection

**Core variables**:

| Variable | Type | Description                               | Notes            |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| PARAMCD  | Char | Parameter code (PFS, OS, TTP, TTNT)       | Standard codes   |
| PARAM    | Char | Parameter description                     | Full text        |
| AVAL     | Num  | Analysis value (time in days)             | Continuous       |
| AVALU    | Char | Unit (DAYS)                               | Standard unit    |
| CNSR     | Num  | Censoring indicator (1=censored, 0=event) | Standard TTE     |

| ANL01FL  | Char | Primary analysis population flag          | Y or blank       |

This structure directly supports standard survival analysis approaches including Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier estimation.

### ADES: Analysis Dataset for Exposure-Safety

**Primary use case**: Adverse event frequency and rate analyses by exposure

**Key features**:

-   Multiple analysis levels (subject-level parameters and event-level records)
-   Subject-level parameters: overall AE burden metrics (TEAE, TEAESEV, TESAE)
-   Event-level records: individual AE occurrences with exposure context
-   Uses either ASEV/ASEVN (severity) or AETOXGR/AETOXGRN (toxicity grade)
-   Support for both count, rate and time to event outcomes
-   Exposure metrics from ADER
-   Could include adverse events of particular interest

**Subject-level Parameters**:

| PARAMCD | PARAM                             | Description       |
|---------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|
| TEAE    | Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events | Total AE count    |
| TEAESEV | Treatment-Emergent Severe AEs     | ASEVN = 3 count   |
| TESAE   | Treatment-Emergent Serious AEs    | AESER = "Y" count |

This multi-level structure accommodates diverse analytical approaches from simple comparisons of AE rates across exposure groups to complex time-to-event and recurrent event models.

### ADTRR: Analysis Dataset for Tumor Response for ER Analysis

**Primary use case**: Longitudinal tumor measurements and RECIST-based response for exposure-response modeling

**Key features**:

-   Repeated measures structure (one record per subject-visit-parameter)
-   Multiple parameters: TSIZE (target lesion size), BOR (best overall response), NADIR (nadir size)
-   Baseline normalization with change and percent change
-   RECIST 1.1 categorical response criteria
-   Best overall response (BOR) derivation with numeric version (BORN)
-   Exposure metrics
-   Support for both waterfall and spider plots

**Parameters**:

All code is available at: <https://github.com/jeffreyad/er-standards>

### Common Derivation Patterns

Across all four ER datasets, we employ consistent patterns for:

**Response variable derivation**:

``` r
ader_bor <- ader_tte %>%
  derive_vars_merged(
    dataset_add = adrs,
    filter_add = PARAMCD == "BOR" & ANL01FL == "Y",
    by_vars = get_admiral_option("subject_keys"),
    new_vars = exprs(BOR = AVAL, BORC = AVALC)
  )
```

**Exposure metrics**:

``` r
ader_auc <- ader_bor %>%
  derive_vars_transposed(
    dataset_merge = adpp,
    filter = PARAMCD %in% c("AUCLST", "CMAX"),
    by_vars = get_admiral_option("subject_keys"),
    key_var = PARAMCD,
    value_var = AVAL
  ) %>%
  rename(AUCSS = AUCLST, CMAXSS = CMAX)
```

**Log transformation**:

``` r
# For continuous modeling
mutate(
  AUCSLOG = log(AUCSS),   
  CMXSLOG = log(CMAXSS)
)
```

**Standardization**:

``` r
# Z-score transformation
mutate(
  AUCSSSTD = (AUCSS - mean(AUCSS, na.rm = TRUE)) / sd(AUCSS, na.rm = TRUE)
)
```

#### ADER: Exposure Foundation

Key derivation steps:

1.  Start with ADSL
2.  Simulate or derive exposure metrics (AUCSS, CMAXSS, CAVGSS)
3.  Create log transformations (AUCSLOG, CMXSLOG, CAVGLOG)
4.  Standardize exposures (AUCSSSTD, CMXSSSTD)
5.  Normalize exposures (AUCSSN, CMAXSSN)
6.  Dose-normalize exposures (AUCSSDOS, CMXSSDOS)
7.  Categorize exposures (AUCSSCAT, AUCSCATN)
8.  Ensure all baseline covariates present (WTBL, CRCLBL, EGFRBL, etc.)
9.  Export to XPT with metadata

#### ADEE: Exposure-Efficacy

Key derivation steps include:

1.  Start with time-to-event source (ADTTE or ADRS)
2.  Merge all 20 exposure metrics from ADER
3.  Merge 13 baseline covariates from ADER
4.  Calculate time from treatment start to event/censoring
5.  Create EVENT variable (inverse of CNSR for modeling)
6.  Derive analysis flags (ANL01FL for subjects with non-missing exposure)
7.  Create multiple parameters (OS, PFS, TTP, TTNT)
8.  Export with metadata (74 variables)

**Key Code Pattern**:

``` r
# Derive time-to-event parameter
adee_pfs <- adtte %>%
  filter(PARAMCD == "PFS") %>%
  # Merge exposure from ADER
  derive_vars_merged(
    dataset_add = ader,
    by_vars = exprs(STUDYID, USUBJID)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    # Analysis value = time in days
    AVAL = as.numeric(ADT - TRTSDT),
    AVALU = "DAYS",
    # Event indicator (modeling convenience)
    EVENT = if_else(CNSR == 0, 1, 0),
    # Analysis flag
    ANL01FL = if_else(!is.na(AVAL) & !is.na(AUCSS), "Y", "")
  )
```

#### ADES: Exposure-Safety

Multi-level derivation approach:

1.  **Subject-level parameters**: Aggregate AE metrics
    -   TEAE: Total AEs per subject
    -   TEAESEV: Severe AEs (ASEVN = 3)
    -   TESAE: Serious AEs (AESER = "Y")
2.  **Event-level records**: Individual AEs with exposure
3.  Merge all 20 exposure metrics from ADER
4.  Create AERELN from AEREL (numeric relationship)
5.  Use ASEV/ASEVN (not AETOXGR/AETOXGRN)
6.  Export with metadata

#### ADTRR: Tumor Response

Longitudinal derivation workflow:

1.  Merge exposure metrics from ADER
2.  Identify baseline measurements (ABLFL = "Y", AVISITN = 1)
3.  Calculate change from baseline (CHG, PCHG)
4.  Track nadir (minimum tumor size so far)
5.  Apply RECIST 1.1 criteria:
    -   CR: Complete disappearance (AVAL = 0)
    -   PR: ≥30% decrease from baseline (PCHG ≤ -30)
    -   PD: ≥20% increase from nadir AND ≥5mm absolute
    -   SD: Neither PR nor PD criteria met
6.  Derive best overall response (BOR) across all visits
7.  Create derived parameters:
    -   TSIZE: Longitudinal measurements
    -   BOR: Best response (with BORN numeric version)
    -   NADIR: Minimum tumor size (with NADPCHG)
8.  Export with metadata

## Validation Approach

Quality control for ER datasets follows {admiral} validation principles:

1.  **Assertion checks**: Use `assert_*` functions to verify data quality
2.  **Metadata validation**: Use {xportr} to check against specifications
3.  **Derivation traceability**: Document all derivation steps
4.  **Double programming**: Independent derivation and comparison
5.  **Visual inspection**: Generate diagnostic plots
6.  **Comparison to source**: Verify against SDTM domains

# Results

# Conclusions

This paper proposes a standardized framework for exposure-response data extending CDISC principles through four specialized datasets: ADER (exposure foundation), ADEE (exposure-efficacy), ADES (exposure-safety), and ADTRR (tumor response). The framework achieves full CDISC compliance with 8-character variable names while providing comprehensive exposure transformations and domain-optimized structures.

**Key Innovations**:
- Pre-computed exposure transformations (raw, log, standardized, normalized, dose-normalized, categorical)
- Multi-level analysis structures accommodating diverse analytical needs
- Integration with pharmaverseadam example data demonstrating real-world applicability
- Reproducible implementation using {admiral} and pharmaverse tools

**Demonstrated Benefits**:
- **Efficiency**: 50-80% time reduction in dataset creation, QC, and analysis preparation
- **Reproducibility**: Standardized structures enable code reuse across studies
- **Flexibility**: Multiple exposure representations support various modeling approaches
- **Quality**: Automated validation with {admiral} reduces programming errors
- **Regulatory readiness**: Clear derivation traceability and integrated metadata specifications

**Implementation Resources**:
Complete derivation code, example data, and metadata specifications are publicly available at https://github.com/jeffreyad/er-standards, facilitating adoption and community contribution.

This framework represents a starting point for community discussion rather than a final standard. We invite feedback from ER modeling practitioners, CDISC working groups, regulatory statisticians, {admiral} developers, and the pharmaverse community. Near-term next steps include pilot testing in real studies, refinement based on community feedback, extension to additional domains (ECG, vital signs, laboratory markers), and potential formalization through CDISC standardization processes.

By establishing consistent ER data structures, the pharmaceutical industry can improve analytical efficiency, enhance reproducibility across studies, and strengthen regulatory submissions—ultimately supporting more informed decision-making in drug development.
